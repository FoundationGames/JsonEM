# JsonEM (Json Entity Models)

Custom entity models with JSON in Minecraft 1.18 designed around Minecraft's internal entity model system <br/>
Vanilla entity models will automatically be dumped to json at `.minecraft/jsonem_dump` upon launching the game <br/> <br/>
**Use the format of those dumped models in a resource pack to replace any vanilla or modded entity model easily and compatibly**
